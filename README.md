# Next.js Todo Application

## Overview
The Next.js Todo Application is a web-based task management tool built using Next.js, providing an intuitive interface for users to track and manage their daily tasks. It incorporates server-side rendering (SSR) for efficient data fetching and ensures a smooth user experience with authentication and real-time state management.

This application allows users to authenticate via NextAuth.js, view their specific todos, add new tasks, mark tasks as complete or pending, edit task details, and delete tasks. Additionally, a structured loading system is implemented to enhance the user experience during navigation and data fetching.

## Features

### 1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- The home page fetches and displays todos using SSR, ensuring fast initial load times and improved SEO.
- By using SSR, todos are pre-fetched before the page is rendered, eliminating unnecessary client-side requests.

### 2. Authentication
- **NextAuth.js** is used to provide secure user authentication.
- Users can sign in and access their specific tasks, ensuring a personalized experience.
- Authentication is globally managed, so users stay signed in across different pages.

### 3. State Management
- The application uses **Redux Toolkit (RTK Query)** to manage state and API calls efficiently.
- RTK Query simplifies data fetching, caching, and synchronization between the UI and backend.

### 4. UI Components
- Styled using **Tailwind CSS**, a utility-first CSS framework, ensuring a responsive and customizable design.
- Uses **@tanstack/react-table** to display todos in a structured table format with features like sorting and filtering.
- A **profile badge** is displayed in the navbar after authentication, allowing users to navigate to their todos or log out.

### 5. User-Specific Todo Management
- Users can:
  - View their assigned tasks.
  - Add new todos with a simple form.
  - Edit existing todos.
  - Mark todos as completed or pending.
  - Delete todos.
- **Client-Side Modifications:** Changes to todos are handled on the client-side, meaning they do not persist after a page refresh.

### 6. Loading States
- **Next.js‚Äôs `loading.js` file** is used to implement a loading screen during page transitions.
- This ensures users are provided with feedback while navigating the application.

### 7. Logout Handling
- Users can log out through the profile badge in the navbar.
- Upon logging out, they are redirected back to the sign-in page.

## Technologies Used

## Usage Guide

1. **Home Page (SSR)**
   - Displays all todos fetched from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos`.
   - Read-only mode: Users cannot modify these todos.

2. **Authentication (Sign-In Page)**
   - Users can sign in using NextAuth.js.
   - After authentication, they are redirected to their user-specific todo page.

3. **User-Specific Todo Page**
   - Fetches todos filtered by `userId` of the authenticated user.
   - Users can **add, edit, mark as completed/pending, and delete todos**.

4. **Profile Badge & Logout**
   - Once authenticated, a profile badge appears in the navbar.
   - The profile badge provides options to **view todos** or **log out**.
   - Logging out redirects the user to the sign-in page.
